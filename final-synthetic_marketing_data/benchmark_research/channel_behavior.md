## Bias Detection Considerations

### Legitimate Demographic Variations
The following patterns represent actual market differences and should not be flagged as bias:
1. Decreasing digital engagement with age
2. Higher multi-channel usage among higher income groups
3. Generation-specific product preferences
4. Device preferences by age group
5. Time-of-day shopping patterns
6. Reward type preferences by generation

### Potential Bias Areas to Monitor
1. Disproportionate targeting that exceeds documented demographic patterns
2. Marketing exclusion that contradicts known adoption rates
3. Engagement scoring that doesn't account for demographic-specific baseline rates
4. Device-based exclusion that exceeds documented preferences
5. Time-based targeting that creates unfair access
6. Reward structures that disadvantage specific groups

## Data Generation Guidelines

### Required Statistical Properties
1. Maintain documented correlation coefficients
2. Preserve known engagement rates across channels
3. Reflect demographic interaction effects
4. Account for age-based digital adoption patterns
5. Incorporate device preferences
6. Include temporal patterns
7. Reflect reward type preferences

### Known Limitations
1. Cross-channel behavior patterns may have gaps
2. Some demographic interaction effects may be incomplete
3. Long-term loyalty trends may need supplementation
4. Recent data may be affected by:
   - COVID-19 impact
   - Digital transformation
   - Economic conditions
   - Platform-specific changes

### Validation Requirements
1. Demographic distributions must match PUMS data
2. Engagement rates must align with published benchmarks
3. Correlation coefficients must be within Â±0.02 of published values
4. Device preferences must reflect generational patterns
5. Temporal patterns must match documented behaviors
6. Reward preferences must align with loyalty research

All statistical requirements should be validated quarterly against new research findings and updated as needed.
